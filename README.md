# Tomato Leaf Disease Classification

This project focuses on the classification of tomato leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It utilizes a dataset containing approximately 5000 images of tomato leaves affected by various diseases, including Early Blight, Target Spot, Bacterial Spot, Mosaic Virus, as well as images of healthy tomato leaves.

## Overview

Tomato Leaf Disease Classification aims to automate the detection and classification of diseases affecting tomato plants. By leveraging CNNs, a powerful deep learning technique for image classification, the model can accurately identify different types of diseases based on images of tomato leaves.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of around 5000 images of tomato leaves. These images are categorized into five classes:

1. Early Blight
2. Target Spot
3. Bacterial Spot
4. Mosaic Virus
5. Healthy Leaves

## Model Accuracy

The CNN model achieved an impressive accuracy of 94% on the test dataset. This high accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in accurately classifying tomato leaf diseases.

## Model Architecture

The architecture of the CNN model used for tomato leaf disease classification is designed to effectively learn and extract features from the input images, enabling precise classification of different disease types.

## Usage

To use the model for disease classification:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the provided scripts or notebooks to train the model or make predictions on new images.
